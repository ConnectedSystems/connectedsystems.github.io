I am a PhD Candidate and software developer with the Integrated Catchment Assessment and Management Centre at the Australian National University. My primary research focus is on the methods and approaches for the development of integrated multi-system models for use in exploring socio-economic, policy and management futures. I hold two masters degrees; a Master of Technology and a Master of Environment (Research) in Natural Resource Management. 

As part of my research I have played a major role in the development of an integrated multi-system model that represents a socio-environmental system. For this purpose I developed a zone-based farm model which represents (cereal) cropping, irrigations, and farmer management decisions. I additionally played a significant and active role in the development (including calibration and data analysis), and integration of models to represent surface water, groundwater, policies and ecological and recreational suitability. Coupling these models together allows for their interactions to be represented. The model was used to explore climate and policy change futures with respect to farm profitability and ecological impact.

Outside of this work, I have contributed to several open-source modelling projects related to environmental research including sensitivity analysis and bibliometric analysis. 

I am experienced with Python and R, and has worked with Fortran, C, MATLAB, and more recently, Julialang.

## Related work

I am an active contributor to the [SALib Python package](https://github.com/salib/salib).

I have developed code and packages to simplify the [statistical analysis of spatial data](https://github.com/MamadioCMCC/HazardRiskScripts/tree/master/scripts/HazardStats).

I assisted in an [independent review](https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/237587298?selectedversion=NBD66255631) of the Queensland Govt. Paddock to Reef Modelling Program.

I have run workshops for students and staff on Integrated Modelling and exploratory interactive visualization, including a workshop run at Hohai University, Nanjing China.

I have an interest in linguistics and Natural Language Processing and have applied these in conducting a bibliometric review of tools and methods for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis. For this purpose I developed the [Wosis](https://github.com/ConnectedSystems/wosis) package which supports interaction with the Web of Science web API, data analysis processes including visualization.

I also enjoy working and helping others improve computational performance of their models. Some examples are:

- Improvements to a spatial flood damage model to increase usability and reduce runtime in conjunction with a PhD candidate from Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei (Italy). The model estimates the amount of damage to physical assets, and impact on the economy (in terms of GDP) and population. Runtime was reduced from a reported 20mins to around 5 minutes.

- Similarly, I aided a fellow student optimise an ecological response model developed at the CSIRO, including porting some code from Python to Cython. Runtime was reduced from a reported 5 hours to 10-15 minutes.
